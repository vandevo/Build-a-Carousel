/*
    Styling the Carousel

    1) Set a max-width of 600px & position relative on the div 'carousel'
    2) Hide all 'carousel-item' divs
    3) Make sure all images inside 'carousel-item' have a max-width that matches the main 
    'carousel' div
    4) All images within 'carousel-item' must be responsive, so think about setting a 
    max-width on the images and how you'd make the image 100% width of 'carousel-item' 
    5) We want the first 'carousel-item' to be visible, think about the class we added 
    to the first item. Make sure that class is always shown
    6) The 'carousel-actions' needs to be on top of the slider, so think about positioning 
    and how you can use relative/absolute positioning to put the 'carousel-actions' on top of 
    the slider
    7) Make some beautiful buttons!
    8) Space those buttons from the left & right - we want to make sure they're not touching 
    the edges of the slides, but adequately spaced
